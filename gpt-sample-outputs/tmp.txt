The client's problem is that their manufacturing process is generating defective parts, which results in a loss of 500 Euros per defective unit. To address this issue, the company wants to use AI to automate their processes. The first step is to understand their current defect detection process, any available data or metrics, and the root causes of the defects.

To find a suitable AI solution for this problem, the company could perform the following steps:

Analyze available data: By looking at historical data, the company can identify patterns that may indicate common causes for the defects. This could involve processing unstructured data in text reports using information processing techniques.

Identify potential solutions: Based on the data analysis, the company can identify potential AI solutions that could help reduce the occurrence of defects. For example, predictive maintenance algorithms could be used to identify when maintenance is necessary, reducing the likelihood of part failure. Additionally, quality control through visual inspection using image recognition could detect defects faster and more accurately than a human worker.

Implement and test the solution: The company can start by implementing a small-scale AI solution and testing it to ensure it works as intended. This could involve creating a prototype model and running it in a controlled environment. After testing, any necessary adjustments can be made before scaling up the solution to the full production environment.

Monitor and improve: Once the AI solution is in place, the company should continue to monitor its performance over time. This could involve collecting and analyzing data after the solution has been in operation for some time, using natural language processing techniques to summarize performance reports. Any necessary improvements can be identified and implemented based on this analysis.

By taking these steps, the company can identify and implement effective AI solutions to reduce the occurrence of defects, save money, and improve their manufacturing process.
